        Through each generation we’ve adapted and evolved, always keeping our sights set on creating
        the highest quality olive oil, while balancing our time-honored traditions with new
        innovative techniques.\n\n
        We’re passionate, even obsessive, about environmental sustainability,
        and we’re constantly looking to find ways to decrease our footprint on mother earth.\n\n
        We also share a strong sense of community with our customers, fellow farmers, and our beloved Santa
        Rosa neighbors who have embraced our business for many decades. Our high ethical standards
        and well-defined values are central to everything we do.
